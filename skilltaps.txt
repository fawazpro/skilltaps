THE NEED FOR WHAT WE DO.
It is ironic to see human beings created in the image and likeness of God go through life devoid of purpose, vision and direction; living in pains, disharmony, insecurity, strife, poverty, hopelessness and un-fulfilment in the midst of plenty, on the very Earth that God created and saw that it is perfect with all things therein.
A great majority of the people (over 95%) are simply existing in a state described by Jim Rohn as ‘Living Death’. This means that over 95% of the people walking the planet earth exist in non-existence. They lack value and substance. Their God’s given potentialities are wasted and their places here on earth are left vacant, unfilled. This is tragedy.  
There are equal opportunities and resources swimming within and around everyone. Why not take the opportunity and put the resources to use and create abundance and a life of meaning and fulfilment?
First is ignorance; ignorance of who they are, the power they have and the resources available for them. Second is lack of desire and knowledge of the principles and laws that govern the acquisition of wealth, riches and abundance. These are the constituents of what we learn, teach and practise on this platform. 

Teaching Methods
E-manuals, videos, zoom, physical contacts through seminars, conferences, workshops, practical-hands-on projects training and study groups are adopted. 
Skilltaps has chapters located at towns and cities around the country. Find the one nearest to you and join them.

Business Networking
Q	What is Business Networking and why should I be interested?

An open doorway for the young school leavers, graduates of tertiary institutions and the unemployed members of our society to generate start-up capital and gain the necessary education and experience needed to start their own businesses.
Rapid development and transformation of members’ mind-sets and financial statuses.
Reduction in the financial burdens and stress as a result of total dependence on one particular member of a family for the overall sustenance of the entire family, thereby reducing internal grudging, rancour and divorces among married couples.
Opportunity for civil servants/ salary earners with little or no business experience to start building their own businesses on part time bases (moon-lighting) while learning the ropes for full-time entrepreneurship on retirement.
Encourages meeting new people and making new friends thereby leading to accelerated market growth and expansion.
10. Encourages business innovation, diversification and expansion.
11. Promotes brotherly love, sense of belongingness and peace 
  amongst people of diverse cultures, traditions and races.
