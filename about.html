					<h2>It is not an easy path</h2>
					<p>Striking out on your own as an entrepreneur is not an easy path to follow, especially in these
						times, but it is a rewarding and fulfilling one. It is an opportunity for you to define and
						create your own future; your very essence, and leave something worthwhile for the generations
						that follow. If you are committed to an unending-lifelong learning, ready to help solve other
						people’s problems and willing to take risks, it might be just the right option career for you.
					</p>
					<h2>Teaching Methods</h2>
					<p>E-manuals, videos, zoom, physical contacts through seminars, conferences, workshops,
						practical-hands-on projects training and study groups are adopted. <br> Skilltaps has chapters
						located at towns and cities around the country. Find the one nearest to you and join them.</p>

				<div class="offset-lg-1 col-lg-6 col-sm-12 col-md-9">
					<h2 class="text-capitalize pt-2">The need for what we do</h2>
					<p>It is ironic to see human beings created in the image and likeness of God go through life devoid
						of purpose, vision and direction; living in pains, disharmony, insecurity, strife, poverty,
						hopelessness and un-fulfilment in the midst of plenty, on the very Earth that God created and
						saw that it is perfect with all things therein.</p>
					<p>A great majority of the people (over 95%) are simply existing in a state described by Jim Rohn as
						‘Living Death’. This means that over 95% of the people walking the planet earth exist in
						non-existence. They lack value and substance. Their God’s given potentialities are wasted and
						their places here on earth are left vacant, unfilled. This is tragedy.</p>
					<p>There are equal opportunities and resources swimming within and around everyone. Why not take the
						opportunity and put the resources to use and create abundance and a life of meaning and
						fulfilment?</p>
					<p>First is ignorance; ignorance of who they are, the power they have and the resources available
						for them. Second is lack of desire and knowledge of the principles and laws that govern the
						acquisition of wealth, riches and abundance. These are the constituents of what we learn, teach
						and practise on this platform.</p>
